Modern data science and machine learning present new challenges that calls for robust theoretical frameworks to analyze complex, high-dimensional data and to ensure reliable inference from data driven methods. My research aims to devise innovative statistical methodologies that provide rigorous theoretical guarantees, with applications in contemporary data driven science. My current research interests organized around these themes: 

1. **Selective Inference**

2. **Theoretical Machine Learning**
