Modern data science and machine learning present new challenges that calls for robust theoretical frameworks to analyze complex, high-dimensional data and to ensure reliable inference from data-driven methods. My research aims to devise innovative statistical methodologies that provide rigorous theoretical guarantees, with applications in cutting-edge data-driven science. My current research interests organized around these themes: 

1. **Selective Inference**

2. **Theoretical Machine Learning**
